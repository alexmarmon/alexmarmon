  "copy": "After childhood stints in Wasilla, Alaska and Salt Lake City, Utah, I’ve spent most of my life in Post Falls, Idaho. I’ve been in professional development for over five years and have only become more inspired to continue to learn and grow in this career. As a developer, I am envious and appreciative of beautiful designs and always love the opportunity to bring them to life. <br><br>My long term passion is to start an incubator in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho that will empower the talented designers and developers in the area to bring their ideas to life.",
